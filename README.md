## Ways to create Mobile Apps
* [Native Frameworks]
* [Hybrid Apps]
* [Developing Mobile Apps using Web Apps]
<h3>In Native Apps</h3>
<p>In case of Native Apps we use native tools as</p>
<li>for developing Android device we use Java and Kotlin</li>
<li>for developing Ios we use objective C and Swift</li>
<li>Native Frameworks is used by Google and Apple thats why they gets updated with new features in regular intervals</li>
<h3>Disadvantage of Native Frameworks</h3>
<li>When we develope native application, we have to create two seperate application for both platforms.</li>
<li>Which means we have to made two code base for each platforms, which requires a lot of time and resources.</li>
<li>It also cost a lot of money.</li>
<h3>In Web Apps</h3>
<li>Html, Css and Javascript used to build responsive websites for android and Ios Display.</li>
<h3>Hybrod Apps</h3>
<li>In case of Hybrid Application, we can made or build it using one or more Code Base.</li>
<li>Xamarin, Cordava, Ionic, ReactNative are some frameworks used in building of Hybrid Apps but in case of Advanced features they are not compatible. So, we use flutter which have a lot of features that is lacking in other frameworks.</li>
<h3>How Flutter Different ?</h3>
<li>Flutter used Dart as a language so we basically develope flutter using Dart</li>
<li>Dart is strongly typed object oriented language developed by Google</li>
<li>Dart has very fast development cycle because it supports JIT(Just in Time) Compilation which is a kind of compilation that results in faster compilation of code during application developement that is whenever we make any changes to our code, we can able to reload our application in our device very fastly in no time. It is called as a Heart reload of the Application.</li>
<li>When app is ready to launch in market Dart supports AOT(Ahead of Time) Compilation.</li>
